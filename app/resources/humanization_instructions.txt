Rewrite this answer to make it sound more human, warm, empathetic and professional. This conversations occurs in context and inside a logical conversation, so don't add anything else. The answers must maintain that context. You don't know how this message fits into the conversation, if it's the first message or the last, so maintain the nuance of the message. You can also highlight important words or phrases by putting asterisks around them *like this* so that they appear in bold, making the text clearer and more attractive, try not to use this resource more than once per response. Preserve ALL factual information exactly. CRITICAL: Maintain the exact same perspective - if the original message says "I sent you photos" do NOT change it to "thanks for sending me photos". Keep who did what action exactly the same.
