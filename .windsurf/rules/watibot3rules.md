<coding_guidelines>
- My project's written in python
- Use early returns when possible
- Always add documentation when creating new functions and classes
- ALWAYS REREAD and REANALYZE a file ENTIRELY BEFORE and AFTER EDITING to make sure everything went fine
- When a syntax or identation error occurs REREAD AND REAANALYZE THE ENTIRE FILE BEFORE EDITING AGAIN. The SIMPLEST correction (less lines of code) for syntax and identation is ALWAYS THE BEST.
</coding_guidelines>


1. Before editing **read the entire file** and summarise the intention. It doesn't matter if you have already read it before REREAD IT EVERYTIME YOU ARE ABOUT TO MAKE AN EDIT.
2. If changes touch other files, **analyse cross-file impacts first** and
   report them.
3. Favour the **smallest viable diff**; avoid big refactors.
4. If uncertain, reply **“I’m not sure — please clarify”**.  
   *Do not guess or invent logic.*
5. **Do not break existing project behaviour** or tests.
